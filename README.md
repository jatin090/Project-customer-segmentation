### Clustering Project

### After exploring, I have cleaned the dataset and chose only a few features which was important in order to carry out the training 

There were 8 features in total, from which we have extracted 3 only

From those three, we first plotted the cluster with random value 4, but later on we checked it with 2 different techniques

We have used the Elbow method for having the range of cluster numbers -  we had range [3,8]

We checked this range, by the help of Silhoutte Score, the number 3 was giving the highest score in the given data, so we have chosen k = 3

At the end we have plotted the cluster visualization with 3 different clusters
