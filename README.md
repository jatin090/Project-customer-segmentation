The aim was to analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists purchases made by  âˆ¼ 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09). Based on this analysis, I developed a model that allows to anticipate the purchases that will be made by a new customer, during the following year and this, from its first purchase.

### After exploring, I have cleaned the dataset and chose only a few features which was important in order to carry out the training 

There were 8 features in total, from which I have combined a few and made only 3 features.

From those three, I first plotted the cluster with random value 4, but later on we checked it with 2 different techniques

I have used the Elbow method for having the range of cluster numbers -  we had range [3,8]

I checked this range, by the help of Silhoutte Score, the number 3 was giving the highest score in the given data, so I have chosen k = 3

At the end I have plotted the cluster visualization with 3 different clusters
